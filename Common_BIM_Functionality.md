## Common BIM Functionality


This table outlines similar functionality that is present in common, authoring BIM platforms.  The intention is to find the lowest-common-denominator functionality---functionality that could be a prime candidate for the development of a future **RoundTrip MVD**.

* [What](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/mvd-overview) is an MVD?
* [What](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/specifications/ifc-view-definition) are the current, sanctioned MVDs?

*(Please include other platforms, as you see fit, in the table below)*
